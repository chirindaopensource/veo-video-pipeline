        "\n",
        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestrator is built around the `VertexTTSOrchestrator` class, which coordinates several key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`TTSRequest` Dataclass:** A structured and validated representation of a text-to-speech request.\n",
        "2.  **`VoiceQuality` Enum:** Manages voice quality tiers and associated cost/free-tier information.\n",
        "3.  **Intelligent Voice Selection:** Dynamically chooses the optimal voice based on request parameters, available voices, and cost-saving strategies.\n",
        "4.  **Caching Layer:** (`_get_from_cache`, `_put_in_cache`): In-memory cache for storing and retrieving synthesized audio, reducing API calls.\n",
        "5.  **API Interaction Layer:** Handles communication with the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.\n",
        "    *   **`CircuitBreaker`:** Wraps API calls to manage service unavailability.\n",
        "    *   **`AdaptiveRateLimiter`:** Controls the rate of API calls.\n",
        "6.  **`CostMetrics` Dataclass:** Tracks usage and costs in a thread-safe manner.\n",
        "7.  **Asynchronous Core (`synthesize_speech`, `batch_synthesize`):** Manages concurrent operations efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.\n",
        "*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:**\n",
        "    *   A GCP project with billing enabled.\n",
        "    *   The **Text-to-Speech API** and **Vertex AI API** must be enabled for your project.\n",
        "*   **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`):** Installed and configured with credentials authorized to access your GCP project (e.g., via `gcloud auth application-default login`). Alternatively, a service account key JSON file can be used.\n",
        "*   **Jupyter Notebook Environment:** To run `draft_standalone_audio_layer.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup and Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clone/Download the Notebook:**\n",
        "    Obtain the `draft_standalone_audio_layer.ipynb` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n",
        "    The orchestrator relies on several Google Cloud client libraries and standard Python packages. Install them using pip:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    pip install google-cloud-texttospeech google-cloud-storage google-cloud-aiplatform asyncio logging\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    *(Note: `google-cloud-storage` is listed due to its import, though the GCS caching feature is currently commented out in favor of in-memory caching in the provided code. Other standard libraries like `json`, `hashlib`, etc., are part of Python's standard distribution.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Google Cloud Authentication:**\n",
        "    Ensure your environment is authenticated to Google Cloud. The recommended methods are:\n",
        "    *   **Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Run `gcloud auth application-default login` in your terminal.\n",
        "    *   **Service Account Key:** Download a service account JSON key file with appropriate permissions (e.g., \"Text-to-Speech API User\", \"Vertex AI User\"). Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of this JSON file, or pass the path directly to the `VertexTTSOrchestrator` during initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestrator primarily requires the following configurations, ideally set via environment variables for production deployments:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID. (Required)\n",
        "*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION`: The Google Cloud region for Vertex AI operations (e.g., `us-central1`). Defaults to `us-central1` if not set. (Optional, but recommended)\n",
        "*   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to your service account key JSON file. (Optional if using ADC via `gcloud`)\n",
        "\n",
        "These are used by the `main_usage_example()` function within the notebook. When instantiating `VertexTTSOrchestrator` directly, these (and other parameters like `cost_threshold_usd`) can be passed as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "The `draft_standalone_audio_layer.ipynb` notebook contains all class definitions and the `main_usage_example()` function. To use the orchestrator:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Open the Notebook:** Launch the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code with Python extension).\n",
        "2.  **Run All Cells (or relevant cells):** Execute the cells containing the class definitions (`TTSOrchestratorError` and its descendants, `VoiceQuality`, `TTSRequest`, `CostMetrics`, `CircuitBreaker`, `AdaptiveRateLimiter`, `VertexTTSOrchestrator`).\n",
        "3.  **Instantiate and Use the Orchestrator:**\n",

        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    Refer to the `main_usage_example()` function in the notebook for a comprehensive demonstration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`VertexTTSOrchestrator`:** The main class orchestrating all TTS operations.\n",
        "*   **`TTSRequest`:** Dataclass for defining and validating individual TTS requests.\n",
        "*   **`VoiceQuality` (Enum):** Defines available voice quality tiers and their cost implications.\n",
        "*   **`CostMetrics`:** Thread-safe dataclass for tracking usage, costs, and performance metrics.\n",
        "*   **`CircuitBreaker`:** Implements the circuit breaker pattern for API call resilience.\n",
        "*   **`AdaptiveRateLimiter`:** Manages API request rates dynamically.\n",
        "*   **Custom Exceptions:** A hierarchy of custom exceptions (`TTSOrchestratorError`, `ValidationError`, etc.) for granular error reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Error Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "The system employs a robust error handling strategy:\n",
        "*   **Input Validation:** `TTSRequest` validates all inputs upon instantiation.\n",
        "*   **Custom Exceptions:** Specific exceptions are raised for different error conditions (e.g., `ConfigurationError`, `SynthesisFailedError`, `APICallError`).\n",
        "*   **Circuit Breaker & Rate Limiter:** These components inherently handle and mitigate errors related to service unavailability or rate limiting.\n",
        "*   **Detailed Logging:** Errors are logged with contextual information for easier debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cost Optimization Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestrator implements several strategies to minimize TTS costs:\n",
        "1.  **Intelligent Voice Selection:** Prioritizes standard voices if cost thresholds are approached, even if premium voices are requested.\n",
        "2.  **Caching:** Stores frequently requested audio, significantly reducing API calls for repeated content.\n",
        "3.  **Free Tier Awareness:** The `_calculate_estimated_cost` method considers Google Cloud's free tier limits when estimating costs for individual requests.\n",
        "4.  **Efficient Batching:** Processes multiple requests concurrently, optimizing resource utilization (though cost per character remains the primary driver).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Logging and Monitoring\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The system uses Python's standard `logging` module.\n",
        "*   Logs are structured to include timestamps, logger names, levels, thread names, and messages.\n",
        "*   The `CostMetrics` class provides data that can be periodically snapshot and sent to monitoring systems for tracking TTS usage, costs, and performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running the Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The `draft_standalone_audio_layer.ipynb` notebook includes a `main_usage_example()` asynchronous function. To run it:\n",
        "1.  Ensure all class definitions in the notebook are executed.\n",
        "2.  Set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable (and optionally `GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION` and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`).\n",
        "3.  Execute the cell containing the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, which calls `asyncio.run(main_usage_example())`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output audio files (`output_single_*.mp3`, `output_batch_*.mp3`) will be saved in the same directory as the notebook, and a cost analysis report will be printed to the console and logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **In-Memory Cache:** The current caching mechanism is in-memory. For distributed or persistent caching in larger production systems, integration with external cache stores like Redis or Memcached would be beneficial.\n",
        "*   **Single Notebook Structure:** While convenient for demonstration, for use as a library in larger projects, the classes should ideally be refactored into separate Python modules (`.py` files) for better organization and importability.\n",
        "*   **Dynamic Region/Endpoint Configuration:** While the region is configurable, more advanced endpoint management for Vertex AI or TTS could be added if required.\n",
        "*   **Advanced Analytics:** The current cost analysis is rule-based. More sophisticated trend analysis or predictive cost forecasting could be built on top of the collected `CostMetrics`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Contributing\n",
        "\n",
